Welcome to **Tooling for Data Storytellers**, **Spring 2021** edition!

This is a graduate-level course on fulfilling the vision of Data Storytelling. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to communicate this vision and fill gaps in how data storytellers - who we will just call storytellers - tackle real-world problems through motivational insights and interpretations of the data being generated in the world around them. 


## The Data Story Telling Vision

Vision to be described here.

## Acknowledgement

Setting up the online infrastructure for a book like this is a tremendous undertaking.  I have taken the infrastructure from https://github.com/mitmath/18S191 and am greatly indebted to all the MIT folks, Franklin.jl team, and others who worked to create such a nice deployment of an interactive book.
