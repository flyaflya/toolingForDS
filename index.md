Welcome to **Tooling for Data Storytellers**, **Spring 2021** edition!

This is a graduate-level course on fulfilling the vision of Data Storytelling. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to communicate this vision and fill gaps in how data storytellers - who we will just call storytellers - tackle real-world problems through motivational insights and interpretations of the data being generated in the world around them.
