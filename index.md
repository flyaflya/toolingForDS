# Tooling for Data Storytellers

by [Adam Fleischhacker](https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/adam-fleischhacker/)

Welcome to **Tooling for Data Storytellers**, **Spring 2021** edition!

This is a graduate-level textbook for understanding, creating, and innovating the tools used by data analysts and *data storytellers*. An exemplary data storyteller seeks to unify narrative, math, and code into a coherent package that generates insight and compels action.  As we become creators and innovators of the tools for *data storytellers*, the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) will be our primary workspace - its fast, intuitive, and flexible enough for our goal of equipping the next generation of data storytellers.  

Creating tools to support the *data storyteller* vision (see the next chapter) is fundamental to continually increasing both the speed and quality of our actions; without action nothing changes.  To spur action in our organizations, we will become artisans who support the *data storytelling* craft.  As history shows, this craft is paramount for our adaptability.  The stories guiding our behaviors respond much faster to environmental changes than our DNA can.  In *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*, \cite{Harari2014} echoes this sentiment: 

> "Since large scale human cooperation is based on myths, the way people cooperate can be altered by changing the myths - by telling different stories."

Instead of the story about the hungry lion around the corner that our computer-less ancestors may have told, we learn to tell stories about the measurements we observe and the actions we recommend as a result.  Stories about how to compete, how to better-serve our customers, and how to adapt organizations to an ever-changing world.  

Some may balk that stories are not scientific, but I will disagree.  Our stories will be rooted in explicitly-stated beliefs, rigorous mathematics, transparent algorithms, and in collected data; all of which can be vetted and altered as needed.  These stories will yield both prediction and insight about the world.  If those predictions and insights prove inconsistent with observation, then our stories are wrong.  If they prove to be consistent, however, well then we might just have a story to guide our future actions.  Here is famous storyteller and physicist Richard Feynman echoing these ideas about what is scientific:

## Who is this book for?

This book is written in a friendly and inviting format for anyone who wants to improve the process by which organizations make decisions when using data-driven storytelling and explanations.  However, there is a certain level of math and coding experience that will be necessary to get the most out of this material.  If you are very comfortable with probability, have an intuition about calculus, have basic proficiency coding in any computer language, then you are ready for this book.  If some of those requisites seem scary, I recommend going through ["A Business Analyst's Guide to Business Analytics"](https://www.causact.com) for learning more about representing the real-world using the languages of probability and code.  Also, review Grant Sanderson's YouTube videos on the ["Essence of Calculus."](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)  Lastly, we will be coding in Julia and while the book does not assume previous knowledge of Julia (code for most of the book is supplied), some familiarity with the basics of the language is helpful and can be found in ["Think Julia"](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html).
